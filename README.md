# Bolt: AI-Powered Development Environment

This repository enables seamless development and deployment of an AI-powered coding agent on Cloudflare's global network. It leverages StackBlitz's WebContainers to give an AI model complete control over a full-stack development environment, including the filesystem, package manager, and terminal.

Follow the instructions step by step to set up, develop, and deploy. The guidance here is precise and provenâ€”engineered for efficiency.

## 1. Project Setup

To begin your journey, you must first prepare your local environment.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version specified in `package.json`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- An active [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    First, acquire the source code.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm.git
    cd bolt.new-any-llm
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Next, summon the required packages using `pnpm`.

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Secrets:**
    This project uses a `.dev.vars` file for local development, which is loaded automatically by Wrangler. **Do not** commit this file to version control.

    Create the file by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .dev.vars
    ```

    Now, edit `.dev.vars` and add your secret API keys for the AI providers you wish to use (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).

    ```ini
    # .dev.vars
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
    # Add other keys as needed
    ```

## 2. Local Development

With the setup complete, you can now run the application locally.

The development server is managed by `wrangler`, which provides a high-fidelity emulation of the Cloudflare environment, including access to any configured service bindings (KV, D1, etc.).

Execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the development server, typically available at `http://localhost:5173`. Any changes you make to the source code will trigger a hot-reload.

## 3. Deployment

When you are ready to unleash your creation upon the world, deploying to Cloudflare Pages is a simple, one-step command.

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

Wrangler will build the application and deploy it to your Cloudflare account. You may be prompted to log in if this is your first time.

## 4. Available Scripts

This repository contains several scripts to streamline your workflow:

-   `pnpm run dev`: Starts the local development server with `wrangler dev`.
-   `pnpm run deploy`: Deploys the application to Cloudflare Pages.
-   `pnpm run build`: Builds the application for production without deploying.
-   `pnpm run test`: Runs the automated test suite using Vitest.
-   `pnpm run lint`: Lints the codebase to ensure code quality and consistency.
-   `pnpm run typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.
